# TradeAI

## Overview
TradeAI is an educational project designed to explore fundamental concepts of **Python programming**, **financial markets**, and **applied mathematics**.

The goal of this project is to progressively build a simple trading simulation while staying aligned with my current academic level.  
The project is intentionally kept simple and evolves as new concepts are learned.


## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Market Simulation**  
   - Price evolution modeling  
   - Volatility and randomness  
   - Multi-asset market environment  

2. **AI & Trading Strategy**  
   - Basic decision-making logic  
   - Risk tolerance management  
   - Portfolio handling  

3. **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
   - Price history tracking  
   - Graphical visualization  
   - Performance analysis  


## Requirements
To run this project, you need **Python 3** and the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`


## Setup

It is recommended to use a **virtual environment**.

### Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
````
Install dependancies :
````bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
Running the project :
````bash
python3 main.py
````
